## What could be improved:
    - Unit test cases
    - Contants should be defined at central place
    - Internationalization/Localization is missing
    - Global Error Handler should be implemented, although I tried to minimize exceptions impact by using try/catch
    - Request and Response interceptor should be there

## Concepts I have not used and Why
 - Redux : For the scope of assignment I felt that redux is not necessary here
 - Context: Application/Assignment doesn't has many components (which are being used in nested children fashin) so context api doesn't fit in here



## Build Steps:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
